fragments should detect if they're being loaded standalone? and then autofill the body?? or is it the job of the server?

how do we handle styles in fragments? everything should be in main, so that helps with breakout.

greying out links? kind of hard but possible?

maybe we do in fact docparse and add head elements to a registry of loaded head elements then remove them once done? we need <title>s.
