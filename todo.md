check pages have descriptions

sometimes at the end of navigation, all the way back, we get critical null for the popstate state. not sure why.

using --accent as :focus { outline } is fine until it's red and you think something is wrong

We should probably "bubble bold"... with... :has()? up to folders (update: I don't think this works as :has requires direct selectors)

I think I want custom animations for everything in the logo. battery charge state change is a little boost, blinking/shaking when the lights come on, etc. _update: see utilities/dashboard_

it'd be cool to have all utilities include some styles/files by default. i.e. a \<!--{{!include}}--> or \_lib.html.inc
-> similarly we could \<!--{!include templates/snippets/nav.html.inc}-->

there should also be a utilities index?

better monospace font. all roboto?

update README.md

uh oh 404

maybe we want to fix the \<header> height so it can scroll over into \<main> with menus by making \<body> a display: grid? worried about \<detail> menus spilling off the page.

maybe dev mode should not copy assets?? not sure how to speed it up

adapt switcher to tabs

clicking body doesn't steal focus from menu on mobile

we need to regulate header h1 sizes to presumably fixed width, so that there isn't inconsistent wrapping of the nav list.

I want a simple sideways+fade transition! is that too much to ask? direction can change depending on back/forward nav

clipboard app should be expanded into more of a suite. HTML should be reactive for sure!
