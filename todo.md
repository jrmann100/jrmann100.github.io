It's really hard to dynamically affect styles, and I'm not sure it's worth it. You can use the JS API, as in 509fb21eeb7c4f450419a109e9f4435ee8d68181, but you need to parse CSS selectors, which isn't performant.

Description doesn't work with ichi. Comments are likely getting in the way.

ESLint + Prettier + maybe TypeScript would be nice.
